Intended users: students with lecture video files

Function: output summarized text transcript of uploaded lecture videos

Potential (incorrect) impressions: processes for YouTube (or any) links, processes text/image files, outputs summarized videos, ; correct these or consider for future implementations; consider allowing for transcript uploads (either use directly or cross-compare with generated transcript to get a potentially more accurate version)

Expectations: clean, paragraphed, indented text output (with timestamps?); options to output .txt file (and a shareable link?); 
"level" of summarization can be controlled by a slider or constrained by a user-input parameter (Ex. max. # of minutes, skip examples--will we be at that capability?)

accessibility settings: text-to-speech (either computer-generated audio or spliced from original lecture audio without sounding choppy); color-blind friendly: avoid red/green (overwhelming color profile would be yellow, brown, and blue), further research needed; dark/light mode toggle; extreme: copy UI/UX from other site add-ons for accessibility menus

Home page: doubles as upload page...for now? compact but potentially incohesive

- title: Lecture Videos â€”> Summarized Transcripts (or: Lecture Videos: Summarized.); subtitle: Speed-running recorded lectures not good enough for you? Go get a clean, readable summary of it instead!
    - animations: fade in "lecture videos", typed-out summarized transcripts with flashing INS bar; "fast" animations to indicate speediness
- X minutes of videos uploaded! X minutes of videos truncated! (offer a proportion?) X% transcription satisfaction rate!; feels a little clickbaity, lets temper it
- Upload here! (notes: acceptable files, one file at a time, links not supported atm)
    - loading bar for upload, then a "summarize!" button; clicking leads to result page
- future testimonials LOL
- FAQ:
    - How are you able to summarize videos? We first get a full transcript of the video, then we use [...] to generate a text summary by condensing spoken phrases and omitting redundant content, etc.*
    - What if I can't upload a file for my video summary? As of now, we only take video/audio files. Future support for links is under consideration. [this is a huge blocker, along with not providing a summarized video instead of just transcript]
    - [probably a bunch more Qs but we are at very MVP-level so save for later]
    

Result page:

- result page, *prioritized features:
    - *paragraphed text
    - clean text box for transcript, show time stamps toggle?; consider: options for font sizes, horizontal spacing, even self-editable
    - *stats for video: X minutes long, before vs. after transcript length, before vs. after of # of minutes to read
    - *export button to .txt (and .pdf?), maybe with the user-edited options (see above considerations)
    - share button to a temp link? if above considerations, also editable per-link click
    - short survey: video content (math, nat sciences, CS, humanities, etc.), quality of transcription, etc.; qualitative feedback textbox
